# Module_2_Challenge
## Description

This application is a professional portfolio. I want future employers to be able to see information about me and my work. I'd like to showcase my developer skills so they can evaluate if I am a good fit for their team. Right now, I am early in my bootcamp and so I don't have as much to show as I will in the next few months. I will take the next few months to continue to build my skills and work on projects that I will then be able to showcase in this portfolio.
